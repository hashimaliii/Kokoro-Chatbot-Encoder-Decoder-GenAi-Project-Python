# 🤖 Emotion-Aware Customer Support Agent  
*A Transformer trained from scratch to understand and respond with empathy.*

---

## 🧠 Overview  

This project demonstrates how to build a **Seq2Seq Transformer-based customer support agent** that conditions its responses on the **customer’s emotion** and **situation**.  

Unlike traditional chatbots that respond generically, this model learns to **generate emotionally aware replies**, resulting in more human-like and contextually appropriate conversations.  

---

## 🌟 Why This Project  

Most dialogue systems ignore emotional nuance — they respond correctly, but not *kindly*.  
This project fixes that by training a model to **understand emotion + situation + dialogue context**, producing empathetic replies that feel natural.  

---

## 🧩 What You’ll Get  

✅ Full preprocessing pipeline  
✅ SentencePiece BPE tokenizer trained from scratch  
✅ Custom Transformer encoder–decoder built entirely in PyTorch  
✅ Training loop with BLEU-based early stopping  
✅ Evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE-L, chrF, and Perplexity  
✅ Human evaluation pipeline (`human_eval.csv`) for rating model fluency, relevance, and adequacy  
✅ Optional Streamlit UI for interactive testing or annotation

## 🧰 Key Components  

### 🪄 **Preprocessing**
- Reads `emotion_emotion_69k.csv`  
- Normalizes and structures text as:  
```

Input:  Emotion: {emotion} | Situation: {situation} | Customer: {utterance}\nAgent:
Target: {agent_reply}

````
- Trains a SentencePiece tokenizer on the training split  
- Saves all processed data under `preprocessed/`  

---

### ⚙️ **Model**
- Transformer Encoder–Decoder from scratch  
- Includes:
- Multi-Head Attention  
- Positional Encoding  
- Feed-Forward Layers  
- LayerNorm + Residual Connections  
- Implemented using **pure PyTorch** (no pretrained models)  

---

### 🧮 **Training Details**
- Optimizer: `Adam (betas=(0.9, 0.98))`  
- Learning Rate: `1e-4 – 5e-4`  
- Batch Size: `32 or 64`  
- Gradient Clipping: `max_norm=1.0`  
- Teacher Forcing: ✅  
- Early Stopping (optional): monitors validation BLEU  

---

### 📊 **Evaluation**
- **Automatic metrics:** BLEU, ROUGE-L, chrF, Perplexity  
- **Human evaluation:**  
- Generates `human_eval.csv` with model predictions  
- Human annotators rate:  
  - Fluency (1–5)  
  - Relevance (1–5)  
  - Adequacy (1–5)  

| Input | Reference | Prediction | Fluency | Relevance | Adequacy |
|--------|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Emotion: sad... | “I’m sorry you’re feeling that way.” | “That sounds really tough.” | _ | _ | _ |

---

## 🚀 Usage  

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2️⃣ Preprocess Data

```bash
python preprocessing.py
```

### 3️⃣ Train the Model

```bash
python model.py -batch-size 64 -lr 1e-4 -epochs 10 -decoding beam -beam-size 4 -early-stopping -patience 3
```

### 4️⃣ Generate Outputs for Human Evaluation

```bash
python model.py -only-generate -generate-n 50 -decoding beam -beam-size 6
```

## 🧠 Example

**Input:**

```
Emotion: frustrated | Situation: can’t log into my account | Customer: I’ve tried resetting my password three times!\nAgent:
```

**Generated Reply:**

```
I understand how annoying that must be. Let’s sort this out together — have you received the reset email yet?
```

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

* [ ] Add learning-rate warmup or cosine schedule
* [ ] Implement beam normalization and length penalty
* [ ] Migrate to **PyTorch Lightning** for multi-GPU support
* [ ] Build a **Streamlit UI** for human-eval annotation
* [ ] Experiment with pretrained backbones (T5, BART, etc.)

## 📁 Requirements

```
torch
sentencepiece
tqdm
sacrebleu
rouge-score
pandas
numpy
```

---

## 🧪 Optional Add-ons

**Streamlit Human Evaluation UI**
A lightweight interface for rating model outputs (Fluency / Relevance / Adequacy) and exporting updated CSVs.

**Smoke Test Mode**
Run a single-batch forward pass to validate model shapes before full training:

```bash
python model.py --smoke-test
```

## 💬 Closing Thoughts

This repository is a **complete, end-to-end pipeline** for training an *emotionally intelligent dialogue system*.
From **raw data** to **empathetic conversations**, it’s designed to be **educational, modular, and expandable**.

> “Empathy is the highest form of intelligence —
> teaching machines to care is the next frontier.” 💖
